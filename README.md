# Sleeping Monk

_Umberto Eco_ once wrote his opus [The Name of the Rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_of_the_Rose) because he felt like poisoning a monk (in his _Postscript to The Name of the Rose_), while we only want to disturb a meditating monk with an intrusive fly in this fun project.
